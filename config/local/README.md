# conf

By default, the configuration is loaded from config/{ENV}, which can be generated by the following command:

If it is a multi-environment, you can set different configuration directories, such as:
 - config/local local development environment
 - config/test test environment
 - config/staging pre-release environment
 - config/prod online environment
 
 > Environment naming is referenced from：https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/directory_structure

Generate test environment configuration file：
 
 ```bash
cp -r config/localhost config/test
```

To run the program using the local configuration file, the command is as follows:
 
 ```bash
# local start
# You can also directly APP_ENV={env} ./eagle
APP_ENV=local ./eagle -c config
或
./eagle -e local -c config
```
