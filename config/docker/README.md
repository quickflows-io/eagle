# conf

By default, the configuration is loaded from config.local.yaml, which can be generated by the following command:

```bash
cp config.sample.yaml config.local.yaml
```

If it is a multi-environment, you can set different configuration files, such as:
 - config.local.yaml local development environment
 - config.dev.yaml development environment
 - config.test.yaml test environment
 - config.pre.yaml pre-release environment
 - config.prod.yaml online environment

Generate the development environment configuration file:
 
 ```bash
cp config.sample.yaml config.dev.yaml
```

The above configuration can be submitted to code repositories such as Git，`config.local.yaml` Configuration files are not submitted by default。

To run the program using the local configuration file, the command is as follows: 
 ```bash
# local start
# can also be directly ./eagle
./eagle -c config/config.local.yaml
# Development environment starts
./eagle -c config/config.dev.yaml
# Online environment starts
./eagle -c config/config.prod.yaml

```
